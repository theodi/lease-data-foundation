# Lease Data Foundation

This repository contains the foundational data pipelines and processing logic for leasehold datasets, with a primary focus on HM Land Registry (HMLR) leasehold data.

The work in this repository supports the creation of a clean, structured, and high-quality “golden record” of residential leasehold information, enabling scalable analysis and downstream services.

## Scope

The repository covers:

* Filtering and preparation of residential leasehold data
* Parsing and normalisation of lease attributes (e.g. lease dates, terms, remaining years)
* Data quality improvement using deterministic rules and language models
* Batch ingestion and change-only update processing
* Confidence scoring and quality assurance flags

## Status

This repository supports Phase 2 (Pillar 1: Data Foundations) of the Lease project and is under active development.
